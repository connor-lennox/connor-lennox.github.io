                I am currently a Master's student at the University of New Hampshire studying under Professor <a href="https://www.cs.unh.edu/~dietz/">Laura Dietz</a>.
                I am also a member of the Text Retrieval, Extraction, Machine Learning and Analytics (TREMA) lab at UNH.
                My work revolves mostly around Natural Language Processing, with a specific interest in text generation.
                Specifically, my focus is in query-centric text generation, which is distinct from other text generation tasks as the goal is to write text that answers a question or otherwise provides information.

                Outside of research, I work on programming projects that are relevant to my personal interests. 
                I've been a musician for most of my life, and used this as inspiration for my <a href="https://github.com/connor-lennox/Impromptune">undergraduate thesis</a>, in which I used machine learning to write classical music.
                Recently, I've been learning Rust by creating emulators for the <a href="https://github.com/connor-lennox/rust_chip">CHIP-8</a> and <a href="https://github.com/connor-lennox/rgbl">Gameboy DMG</a>.
                In the past, I have participated in a few <a href="https://tripleseven.itch.io/">gamejams</a>, where participants get somewhere between 2-3 days to make a game from scratch.
