                My research is primarily focused around Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I am interested in text generation and query-focused techniques. Recently, I have worked on research projects regarding sequence generation and text summarization.

                My sequence generation project took the form of a music generator called Impromptune, which you can <a href="pubs/impromptune.pdf">read more about here</a>.
                This project served as a way to get acclimated with some Natural Language Processing concepts (just within the domain of music) while also exploring a novel approach to sequence generation with relative attention mechanisms.
                A demo of the music generated by this project <a href="other/impromptune_demo.mp3">is available here</a>.

                My work in text summarization is currently limited to extractive summarization, however I am in the process of working on an abstractive summarization technique.
                Extractive summarization is the approach where the generated summary contains text copied straight from the input. This is great for fact retention and general sentence-level grammar, however it lacks the ability to condense ideas into terser representations.
                Abstractive summarization is the opposite: instead of copying from the input a summary is generated using terms that may not have even been seen in the input.
                Now, it is common to combine the two methods, allowing out-of-vocabulary words to be used in an abstrative summary. This allows things like names, numbers, and other proper nouns to be copied into the summary while still having a flexible summary structure.
