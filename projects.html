                This project was for my undergraduate thesis at UNH. The main motivation was to create a machine learning model that could continue a piece of music, much like how modern text generators continue "prompts" of text.
                To achieve this effect, I took advantage of some techniques that are used in Natural Language Processing to continue sequences of text. Specifically, I borrowed some ideas from the Transformer model and GPT-2, 
                both of which are built on the idea of "Attention" for making predictions. Since music is generally quite structured, this approach worked quite well as prior notes in the sequence 
                were able to inform what should come next.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the novel attention mechanisms I explored in this project was a "Predictive Relative Attention" layer.
                This layer uses a history of the most recent output notes, as well as the overall context of the piece, to predict a distribution of next notes.

                One of the most frustrating parts of starting a new machine learning project is rewriting the same boiler-plate code over and over again.
                To try and alleviate some of this frustration, I've been building a package that wraps the standard PyTorch training process.
                However, a common concern with this type of package is that there will be a trade-off with functionality: by making the training process simpler, there will be less fine-grained control over its behavior.
                I eliminate this concern by opting for a lambda-oriented approach. The exposed functions of my package take functions themselves as parameters, and with this mechanism end users 
                can still achieve fine-grained control over the specifics of the training process.
