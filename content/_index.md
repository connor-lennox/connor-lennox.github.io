# Hey, this is my page.
## It's a place I post stuff I do.

I'm a software engineer with a background in Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence. I graduated with a BS in CS from the [University of New Hampshire](https://unh.edu) in 2021, and an MS in CS in 2022. While I was in university I did a fair amount of research, [which you can read about here](/research/).

Sometimes I do things that aren't work, and you can [read about those too.](/projects/)
